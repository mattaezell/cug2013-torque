\section{Production Experiences}

After initial conversations with Adaptive Computing discussing the transition
of ALPS interactions from Moab to TORQUE to provide better ALPS reservation
synchronization, an initial beta test at scale was undertaken on site at ORNL
in June 2012.  The test was performed using Jaguar and was fairly successful,
but, as expected, pointed out a few modifications that were needed.  Some minor
modifications were needed to clean up reservations correctly with some
additional tweaks needed to support interactive jobs.  We continued the
debugging cycle by running the new batch architecture on two of our Cray test
and development systems (TDS) at ORNL.
