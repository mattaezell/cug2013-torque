\section{Future Work}

Work is ongoing to improve the quality of TORQUE.  Unit testing coverage is
improving, and it will continue to improve over time.  The TORQUE 4.2 series
moved from a C compiler to a C++ compiler, giving access to additional language
constructs as well as the Standard Template Library (STL).  Over time, some of
the one-off TORQUE implementations of standard data structures will be replaced
with their counterparts from the STL.  Additionally, there will be improvement
on the Cray-specific features.  Some specific ideas include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Additional logging of interactions between TORQUE and ALPS, including 
        full XML at high log levels
  \item Taking advantage of new features in higher ALPS BASIL versions, such as
        inventory \emph{changecount} and reservation release claim count
  \item More robust handling of reservation IDs and orphan handling
\end{itemize}
