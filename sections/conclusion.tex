\section{Conclusion}

TORQUE's quality has been somewhat spotty over the last year as major
architectural changes have been implemented.  Thanks to the diligent work of
the TORQUE developers and the community input, TORQUE has significantly
improved.

Cray's ALPS software is very unique, and it requires batch systems to add
special support to interoperate.  Adaptive's original design that interfaced
with ALPS from Moab was effective, but the new TORQUE-based ALPS integration is
more straightforward and higher performing.  The new software provides benefits
that are highly visible to end-users.
